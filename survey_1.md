## Migrating towards Microservice Architectures: an Industrial Survey
### 这是一篇关于从传统架构向微服务架构转移的调查报告

#### 转移包含三个步骤：
migration to services has three steps: reverse engineering, architecture transformation, and forward engineering.

#### 调查的两个问题：
* RQ1 – What are the activities carried out by practitioners when migrating towards a microservice-based architecture?
By answering this research question we aim at characterizing the activities performed during the overall migration process.

* RQ2 – What are the challenges faced by practitioners when migrating towards a microservice-based architecture? 
By answering this research question we aim at characterizing the challenges that practitioners have to face during the migration.



### 总结：
主要调查了人们对这种技术方式的看法
整篇文章看下来并没有太多技术相关的东西，价值不大
