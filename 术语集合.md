### Microservices are a software oriented entity, which have the following features:  

#### Autonomy :   
microservices can be deployed, destroyed,
moved or duplicated independently. Thus, microservices
cannot be bound to any local resource because microservice
environment can create more than one instance of the same
microservice;

#### Isolation from other microservices
as well as from the
execution environment based on a virtualized container;

#### Open and standardized interface  
that describes all
specific goals with effectiveness, efficiency and available
communication methods (either API or GUI);

#### different language
Each microservice can be
developed in a different
programing language.
