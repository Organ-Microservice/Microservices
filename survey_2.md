### Survey on Microservice Architecture - Security, Privacy and Standardization on Cloud Computing Environment
#### 这是一篇关于

* 云计算的安全性  
> The security challenge brought by such network
complexity is the ever-increasing difficulty in debugging,
monitoring, auditing and forensic analysis of the entire
application [21]. Since microservices are often deployed in a
cloud that the application owners do not control, it is
difficult for them to construct a global view of the entire
application [10].

* 微服务对云计算下隐私安全的解决方案，it shows the privacymodel adopted in the cloud applications for microservices.

隐私安全的模型如上图所示，有5个层次：  
1. Physical and Environmental Security
Layer of policies adopted with the objective of
protecting physical access to the cloud provider [5].
2. Cloud Infrastructure Security
Addresses issues with cloud infrastructure security, but
specifically with the virtualization environment [32].
3. Network Security
Specifies the medium to which the end user connects to
the cloud, comprising browsers and their connection [9].
4. Data
Layer covers data privacy, integrity, confidentiality, and
geographic location [22].
5. Access Control and Privilege Management
Policies and processes used by cloud services provider
to ensure that only the users granted appropriate
privileges can use or modify data. It includes
identification, authentication [33] and authorization
issues [29]

* 微服务的标准和解决方案
Microservice API's which are built using internet
communication protocols like HTTP, adhere to open
standards like REST [35][36] and SOAP [2] and use data
exchange technologies like XML [18] and JSON [5].
