## RQ1: What are the main challenges/concerns in the design and
the development process of microservices?

>  “Too many repositories to maintain”, “Hard to find
issues in a distributed system. Rarely any benefit”, “networking between dockers”,
“sharing base data among different services considering performance limitations”,
and “debugging a microservice that relies on other services can be tricky” are
some of these comments. Next common challenge is the skill and knowledge.
It seems that there are difficulties between customers and development teams
in “understanding MS of the Top Management/Director levels”, “getting the
right developers/engineers”, and “Changing the people’s minds that are used
to traditional monoliths”. Finally, “correct separation of domains” and “finding
the appropriate service cuts”
