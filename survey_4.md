### challenges
>   It is often reported that microservices demand distributed data man-
agement and hence distributed transactions, which makes their implementation much
more complex.   
Other studies [Pahl and Jamshidi 2016, Aderaldo et al. 2017] report that
automated tests are extremely important in microservices, especially integration tests,
which can be more complex and time-consuming. In addition, when the tests fail, it can
be harder to determine which functionality has been broken [Newman 2015].   
Service faults are also cited as a challenge when using microservices since the identification of
a fault in a distributed setting is much harder than in a monolithic one.   
Finally, developers often mention that Remote Procedure Calls (RPC) are expensive and take much
longer than local calls, which means that RPC may become a challenge when developing
applications under microservices.
